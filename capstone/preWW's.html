    <h1>The Pre-World Wars History of Ukrainian–Russian Relations</h1>
    <br/>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>From my research, I determined that the Ukrainian and Russian people are divergent from a common ancestor in the 
       Kyivan Russ. Though after the disaster that was the Mongol horde, the state was defeated and split, what was now 
       most of modern Ukraine was under the rule of the Polish Lithuanian commonwealth, and what is the ancestor of modern 
       day Russia was under Mongol rule prior to breaking off into a separate state. After that, the relationship is defined 
       by shifting alliances, deceit, and war. With Ukrainians becoming a flashpoint battleground for the age of empires,
        and being defined by resistance, meanwhile Russia by its effort to subjugate its sister people and take away their 
        autonomy in their efforts to be recognized as the successors of the Russ.  </p>

    <h2>Origins: Kyivan Rus and Early Divergence</h2>
    <p>The Kyivan Russ is the birthplace and origin to which both the Russian and Ukrainian people can trace back their 
       lineage to. This was a powerful medieval state (reached its peak around the 11th century), classified as a Slavic 
       federation which made its capital Kyiv. An important event that will be critical for understanding down the line,
       is the prince Volodymyr of Kyiv embracing orthodox Christianity in 988 A.D... This Pivotal event shaped the fate
       of the people of Russ permanently and would greatly affect the geopolitical events to come.  
       <br/>
       <br/>
 

       Any hope for a united slavic state was shattered y the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. The Mongol conquest of 
       1240 led to the destruction of Kyiv and the fragmentation of Russ. In the aftermath, the trajectories of the Ukrainian 
       and Russian peoples diverged: the population in what is now Ukraine (then known as the Ruthenian lands) came under the 
       influence of emerging European powers (such as Poland), while the northeastern population settled in what would be 
       modern Moscow, embracing and projecting the name of Russ as much as they could in an attempt to legitimize themselves 
       as the successors of the great state that preceded them. 
       <br/>
       <br/>
         
        
       In the aftermath of the Mongol horde, the Muscovites were able to break free of Mongol rule and begin consolidating 
       their standing, meanwhile the Ukrainians were under a different, and hostile, cultural and political orbit of the 
       Polish Lithuanian commonwealth. Both peoples maintained the orthodox faith, however the Ukrainians struggled to do 
       so as the commonwealth was catholic. Both the Commonwealth and the Moscovites claimed the legacy of the Kyivan Russ, 
       and so Ukraine became a contested battleground.  </p>

       <br/>
       <h2>Polish-Lithuanian Rule and Cossack Emergence</h2>
       <p>From the 14th to early 17th centuries, most Ukrainian lands were under the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
          After the Union of Lublin in 1569, Poland directly ruled central and eastern Ukraine, spreading Catholicism and 
          Polonization. Orthodox Ukrainians especially peasants faced pressure, exploitation, and suppression of their religion.

          In response, the Zaporizhian Kozaks rose as defenders of Orthodox Ruthenians. They led multiple uprisings against 
          Polish rule and religious oppression, keeping the dream of Ukrainian autonomy alive despite brutal reprisals.
        
        Meanwhile, the Moscovites was expanding and positioning themselves as Orthodoxy’s protector. Ukraine became a battleground 
        between Poland and Russia most notably during the Polish Moscovite War (1605 1618), when Polish Kozak forces briefly 
        occupied Moscow. By the mid-1600s, discontent exploded into a full scale uprising led by legendary Ukrainian hero 
        Bohdan Khmelnytsky. 
        
        Prior to moving onto the next section, it is important to understand what the Cossack's and Khmelnitsky are. The 
        Cossacks, or Kozaks as pronounced in Ukrainian, are legendary figures in our culture, they were peasants turned 
        warriors, essentially nomadic warrior people who specialized in unorthodox warfare, horseback riding, and more. 
        They are a symbol of pride and freedom for the Ukrainian people. Bohdan Khmelnitsky was a "registered" Kozak 
        under the Polish Lithuanian flag who fought for them against the Ottoman empire. He rose up against them 
        after he was wronged by local government officials, and the king refused to provide justice. He rode to meet 
        his fellow Kozaks, and was elected Hatman, or as Ukrainians say it "Attaman".

        <h2>The Cossack Hetmanate and the Pereyaslav Alliance </h2>
        <p>In 1648, Bohdan Khmelnytsky led a full scale Kozak uprising against Polish rule, unleashing the Khmelnytsky 
          Uprising (1648–1657) which succeeded in toppling Polish control over much of the region.

          The Kozak rebels, joined by local peasants and with support from the Crimean Tatars, won a series of crushing 
          victories over Polish armies and established an independent Kozak state known as the Kozak Hetmanate. However, 
          Khmelnytsky knew that lasting independence would be difficult to secure alone, so he sought a powerful enough 
          ally to secure Ukraine's independence.  
          <br/>
          <br/>
          After several battles were lost against the commonwealth, the Kozak Hetmanate was abandoned by its allies in 
          the Crimean Tatars, and the Ottoman empire. Thus, Bohdan Khmelnitsky sought the aid of Moscow. Seeing as two 
          people share a common root in the Kyivan Russ, as well as shared religious orthodox beliefs, many Ukrainians 
          saw the Moscovites as natural allies. Thus, the treaty of Pereyaslav (1654) came to be, when Khmelnitsky and 
          his officer's pledged allegiance to Tsar Alexei of Moscow in exchange for military support and recognition of 
          the autonomy of the Ukrainian state.  
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Despite the cordial words and ceremonies at Pereyaslav, the two sides interpreted the agreement very differently. 
          The Cossacks believed they were entering a mutual alliance – accepting the tsar’s suzerainty in return for 
          guarantees of autonomy and rights for the Ukrainian Hetmanate. Moscow, however, viewed the treaty as an act 
          of submission, seeing Ukraine as being effectively absorbed as a loyal vassal territory. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          This misunderstanding quickly led to friction. Nevertheless, the immediate result of the alliance was the 
          outbreak of the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), as Moscow entered the ongoing conflict on the Kozaks side. 
          While initial victories were gained, and Ukraine even made a deal with Sweeden that upon the defeat of 
          the commonwealth they would gain much territory back, the Moscovites had other plans. Seeing Sweden as 
          a larger threat and fearing the commonwealths collapse, the Moscovites made a deal with the Polish and 
          Lithuanians to split the territoy of Ukraine down the Dnipro River, effectively betraying the Hetmanate. 
          This was the Truce of Andrusovo (1667). The hetmanate saw this as an utter betrayal, and although there 
          were attempts to ally with the Swedish against Moscow and the commonwealth, it failed. Over the next 
          century the autonomy of Ukraine would be dismantled. This century would be known as “The Ruin”. </p>
